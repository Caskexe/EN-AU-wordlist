# EN-AU Wordlist
## _For mad cun#s who don't speak simplified English_



Australian English Word List. Please bare with me, I am working on overhauling the list so that it is merely a list of words that can be compatible with Microsoft Word and adapted for other dictionary formats as a more-accurate dictionary containing city names, politican names and profanity etc. 

## Features

- Profanity
- Towns, Cities and other Aussie names

## Links
- [Firefox Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/australian-english-dictionary/) - Firefox Browser Add-Ons Page
- [Firefox Extension](https://github.com/Caskexe/Australian-English-Dictionary-Firefox/) - Extension and source on Github

## Notice

Please don't send complaints or report the Firefox extension for profanity. The purpose of the dictionary is to include all coloUrful language used in Australia. As such there are plenty of bad words, slangs and racist remarks included in the dictionary that may not be appropriate for all. Simply don't type the words and they won't need correcting.
